If we apply the driving pulse for a time *t*, the qubit oscillates between the two states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. This behaviour is known as the **Rabi cycle** of the qubit. The unitary operator that leads to this result is called **Rabi driving** and can be written as:\n",

In this more open ended exercise, we explore custom gate and gate implementations.  For this, we will explore other custom waveforms by changing the pulse waveform of an existing gate.  Let's define a new implementation of the PRX gate by using a different waveform, such as a raised cosine pulse.  Below, pick a new waveform and implement it.  Then, run a Rabi experiment, sweeping the pulse full width and pulse amplitude (like in section 3) and plot the results.  Compare the results with other waveforms as well as the standard gate implementation.
